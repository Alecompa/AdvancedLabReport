\subsection{Deep Learning for Pulse Shape Analysis with TRACE}
With the rise of user-friendly machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow [CITE] or Pytorch [CITE], Deep Learning had seen a wide range of applications in physics [CITE]. In experimental nuclear and subnuclear physics pre-trained Neural Network (NN) can be used for task such as event tagging[CITE] or inside the trigger system/acquisition chain in HEP experiments[CITE]. 


In this section an application of NNs to perform particle discrimination using the signals collected from the TRACE detector is presented. Such a technique can be used to inprove data processing speed or even inside the acquisition system in future.
