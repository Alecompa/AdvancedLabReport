An in-depth characterization of TRACE electronical chain and its calibration was performed. The data acquired during the different runs was analyzed in order to reconstruct the structure of each event comprehensive of the PSA variables extracted from the raw signals from the digitizer. Fig.~\ref{imax} and Fig.~\ref{risetime} shows the plot obtained from this analysis.

Finally, it is showed that a trained Neural Network model, which use short traces from the detector as input, is able to discriminate between different kind of signals based on their shape.
