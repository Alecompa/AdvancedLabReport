An in-depth characterization of TRACE electronical chain and its calibration was performed. The data acquired during the different runs was analyzed in order to reconstruct the structure of each event comprehensive of the PSA variables extracted from the raw signals from the digitizer. Fig.~\ref{imax} and Fig.~\ref{risetime} shows the plot obtained from this analysis.

Finally, it is showed that a trained Neural Network model, which use for input short traces from the detector, is able to discriminate protons signals from the $\alpha$ ones.
