\subsection{Deep Learning for Pulse Shape Analysis with TRACE}
With the rise of user-friendly machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow~\cite{tensorflow} or Pytorch~\cite{pytorch}, Deep Learning had seen a wide range of applications in physics~\cite{ml4phys}. In experimental nuclear and subnuclear physics pre-trained Neural Network (NN) can be used for task such as event tagging~\cite{baldi} or inside the trigger system/acquisition chain in HEP experiments~\cite{williams}. 


In this section an application of NNs to perform particle discrimination using the signals collected from the TRACE detector is presented. Such a technique can be used to inprove data processing speed or even inside the acquisition system in future.
